Here I will uploading the questions along with the concepts

Escape sequences allow you to insert special characters in strings. Put a backslash (\) before the character you want to escape.
We can use the Escape Sequences concept to specify actions such as tab movements in the terminal and also for the representation of non-printing characters like new line (\n) or characters that have special meaning like double quotation marks (").
Talking about prevention, we have two methods: either use the double backslash method, which is not possible for a larger string or use the concept of raw string, i.e., adding r or R before the string.
